      intro: "I'm Kgomotso—a proud Black South African woman, storyteller, mother, and curator of African adventures for culturally curious travelers. With deep roots across the continent, my life has been shaped by movement, memory, and meaning.",
      journey: "Born and raised in Africa and now living in the United States, my journey has been defined by both displacement and deep-rooted pride. I spent my formative years in exile, the result of my parents' unwavering commitment to the armed struggle against apartheid. Though marked by hardship, that chapter ignited a profound passion for travel and a lasting connection to my homeland.",
      mission: "From that passion and a deep sense of purpose, Ikhaya KaMa (My Motherland) Vacations was born. More than a travel company, it's a tribute to resilience, heritage, and the beauty of Africa, offering transformative journeys that reconnect travelers to the soul of the continent.",
      philosophy: "Every itinerary is crafted with intention, every experience designed to create lasting memories, and every journey planned to leave both traveler and destination better for the encounter."
