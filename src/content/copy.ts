      intro: "My name is Kgomotso Keene—a proud Black South African woman, mother, storyteller, and curator of African adventures for travelers who crave culture, connection, and meaning.",
      journey: "My life has always been a journey across borders. I was born in Africa, raised across countries, and now divide my time between the United States and Nairobi, Kenya. I am the daughter of parents who fought in the armed struggle against apartheid in South Africa. Because of their sacrifice, my earliest memories aren't of one homeland but of many—temporary homes shaped by resilience, hope, and survival.",
      travelPhilosophy: "For me, travel was never about luxury. It was about identity, belonging, and finding beauty in unfamiliar places. Those experiences taught me that every journey carries a story—and that the most powerful ones connect us to each other.",
      transformation: "Over time, necessity turned into passion. I began to travel not because I had to, but because I wanted to. To learn. To connect. To celebrate cultures, landscapes, and people who expand our perspectives and deepen our humanity.",
      mission: "Today, as a mother and entrepreneur, I've turned that passion into Ikhaya KaMa Vacations (My Motherland Vacations)—a space where Africa isn't just a destination, but a living story of resilience, warmth, and wonder.",
      invitation: "Every itinerary I create is more than a trip—it's an invitation. An invitation to walk the lands where legends were born, to share meals and laughter with local communities, and to carry home not just memories, but meaning.",
      promise: "When you travel with me, you don't just see Africa—you feel it, live it, and become part of its story.",
      conclusion: "This is my story of exile, resilience, and return. Now, I invite you to write your own through travel."
