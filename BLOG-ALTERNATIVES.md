# Blog System Alternatives

Since GitHub Actions were causing persistent issues, here are 3 alternative approaches for managing your blog content:

## Option 1: Manual Script (Recommended) üéØ

**Best for:** When you want to update blog posts occasionally

**How to use:**
```bash
pnpm run update-blog
```

This will:
- Fetch latest African travel news from RSS feeds
- Generate blog posts automatically
- Save them to `src/content/auto-blog-posts.json`

## Option 2: Netlify Functions (Automated) ü§ñ

**Best for:** When you want automated updates without GitHub Actions

**Setup:**
1. Create a Netlify function using `update-blog-netlify.js`
2. Set up a scheduled trigger or webhook
3. Blog posts update automatically

**How to use:**
```bash
pnpm run update-blog-netlify
```

## Option 3: Manual Admin Interface üìù

**Best for:** When you want full control over content

**How to use:**
1. Open `admin-add-post.html` in your browser
2. Fill out the form with your blog post details
3. Click "Add Blog Post"
4. Copy the generated JSON and add it to your blog posts file

## Which Option Should You Choose?

- **Use Option 1** if you want occasional automated updates
- **Use Option 2** if you want fully automated updates via Netlify
- **Use Option 3** if you prefer to write all content yourself

## Quick Start

Try Option 1 right now:
```bash
pnpm run update-blog
```

Then check your blog page to see the new posts!
