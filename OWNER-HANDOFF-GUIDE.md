3. New posts appear on your blog page every 1-2 days

#### 📧 **You'll get emails when:**

- 📊 Weekly summary of what was posted

#### 🛠️ **If something breaks:**
1. **Don't panic!** - Your main website still works
2. Check your email for error notifications
3. Contact your developer with the error message

### Managing Your Blog Content:

#### ✏️ **To add your own blog posts:**
1. Ask your developer to add manual posts
2. They appear alongside auto-generated ones
3. Manual posts are marked with your byline

#### 🚫 **To temporarily stop auto-blogging:**
1. Go to https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo/settings/secrets
2. Find `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Click "Update" and remove the value (leave blank)
4. Auto-blogging stops until you add it back

#### 📝 **To change the writing style:**
Your developer can adjust the AI's writing style by editing the "brand voice" instructions in the system.
